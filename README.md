# Hello, Kenny Hoft here

My portfolio website is hosted on a sub domain at the moment:

## TODO

- Content

  - Add an education section to the about section
  - Add a certificates section to the about section
  - Rework the layout of the about section

- SEO
  - This page is hosted on a subdomain. Use a top level domain for better SEO results.
  - This page loads 10 JavaScript files. This may affect the load time negatively.
  - There are only a few social sharing widgets on the page. Make your website popular in social networks with social sharing widgets.
  - Some anchor texts are used more than once.
  - Add backlinks to the page
  - The page has 0 shares, comments and likes on Facebook.
  - Add a sitemap.xml file
